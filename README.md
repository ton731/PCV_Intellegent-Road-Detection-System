# Photogrammetry_Computer_Vision

- Photogrammetry Computer Vision Final Project
  - 智能道路偵測系統 (Intellegent Road Detection System)
  - Using the straght lines aside the roadand the Vanishing Point, we establish a fast method to build the 2d map of the area without using 3d modeling. Which can help when we only have restricted devices or when we are in the enviroment not suitable for satellite or 3d devices.
